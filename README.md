# Smart Home Security System
## Senior Projects 2023 Univeristy of Houston - Clear Lake
### ----- Project Team -----
- Austin Bernard - Software Design
- Shion Jeegan Michael - Frontend/Database
- Aaron Haish - Hardware Design/3D modeling

### ----- Software Development Phase -----

- [x] Facial Recognition 
- [x] Biometric fingerprint scanner
- [x] Servo motor
- [ ] Keypad
- [x] LCD
- [x] Magnetic contact switches (Door magnets)
- [x] Website/Database (Mostly done but still in the works.)
- [ ] Speaker
- [ ] Alarm
- [ ] 3D Prints

### ----- Features ----- 


	• Biomatric Fingerprint Scanner: for person identification in the double verification process.
	
	• Camera: Once motion is detected camera comes on and will either take a photo/video and will email that picture to the owner, as well as storing the picture/video into a database with the date and time of occurence. The camera will also act as a facial recognition to allow double verification along with the biometric scanner.
	
	• Door lock: If no finger is verified, be able to use a keypad to still allow entry through the lock.
	
	• Keypad: to allow entry incase face isn't recongnized.
	
	• High torque servo motor that will unlock a door upon successful verification.
	
	• Motion sensor to detect movement which will start the verification process.

	• Alarm system with magnetic contact switches to sound an alarm in case of intrusion.
	
	• Unknown faces will be stored in a database, with the date and time, which can be viewed online at any time by the owner and select users.
	
	• 3D printed design for the components on the front of the door, a 3D printed design for the servo motor, as well as a 3D printed box for the back of the door which will contain the Raspberry Pi.

	• Website: to display all of the data with an admin panel.

	• Database: use a database to store all data. Pictures of unknown person plus data and time.

If camera motion is detected, take a picture and email that picture to the owner/s. If door is forced entry, lock isn't unlocked by keypad or biometric scanner, set an actual alarm with the buzzer.
