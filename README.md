- [x] Servo motor
- [ ] Keypad
- [x] LCD
- [x] Magnetic contact switches (Door magnets)
- [x] Website/Database (Mostly done but still in the works.)
- [ ] Speaker
- [ ] Alarm
- [ ] 3D Prints

### ----- Features ----- 


	• Biomatric Scanner: Replacing the facial recognition with a biometric finger scanner. This will allow the person to unlock the door if your finger has been verified.
	
	• Camera: Once motion is detected camera comes on and will either take a photo/video and will email that picture to the owner, as well as storing the picture/video into a database with the date and time of occurence. The camera will also act as a facial recognition to allow double verification along with the biometric scanner.
	
	• Door lock: If no finger is verified, be able to use a keypad to still allow entry through the lock.
	
	• Keypad: to allow entry incase face isn't recongnized.
	
	• Door sensor magnets: to tell if door is closed or has been opened.


	• Speaker: for text to speech
	
	• Buzzer: for alarm incase of forced entry

	• Website: to display all of the data with an admin panel.

	• Database: use a database to store all data. Pictures of unknown person plus data and time.

If camera motion is detected, take a picture and email that picture to the owner/s. If door is forced entry, lock isn't unlocked by keypad or biometric scanner, set an actual alarm with the buzzer.
